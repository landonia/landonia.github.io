## Really! Why? 

So why yet another blog? Tbh, I have no idea. My thinking is that if I write about it, then I may just actually do it. I find myself in a very peculiar place in life. I find that I have energy to apply to my day job (I'm sure my employer is happy about this) but, I always seem to procrastinate when working on any of my own ideas. It's amazing how I always find a film to watch instead of tinkering. 

There are two main projects that I wish to work on that I hope to write more about in the coming months. One is an investment system that will automate my own investments and the second is a public information network. Both interest me the same, but for very different reasons. I will write about these reasons at some point soon.

## Build It and They Will Come

Similar to the build it and they will come quote (I wish that was the case), I am following more of a write about it and I will get off my lazy ass and do it kind of thing.

Thanks for reading.
